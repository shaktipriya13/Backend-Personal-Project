Helps prevent server crashes from very large JSON payloads (e.g., 1MB+ requests).
Acts as a security & performance best practice.
Prevents the server from crashing if someone tries to send a huge request.

// It's a way to make sure that static assets (files that donâ€™t change, like stylesheets, images, or client-side JavaScript) are accessible via URLs without needing additional routing.

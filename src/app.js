/*limit: "16kb" sets a maximum size for the JSON data:
Helps prevent server crashes from very large JSON payloads (e.g., 1MB+ requests).
Acts as a security & performance best practice.
Prevents the server from crashing if someone tries to send a huge request.

app.use(express.static("public"))
// The line app.use(express.static("public")) is used in an Express.js application to serve static files (like images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc.) from a specific directory. It points to the "public" directory, meaning it will look for static files in the public folder of your project.
// It's a way to make sure that static assets (files that donâ€™t change, like stylesheets, images, or client-side JavaScript) are accessible via URLs without needing additional routing.

app.use(cookieParser())
// ! above 3 are major configurations used everywhere


// * Importing and Writing routes here in app.js

import userRouter from './routes/user.routes.js'//manchaha nam hum tabhi de skte ha jab export default ho rha ho
// jab routers and controllers are written in diff files and routers hv to be imported then we hv to use a middleware ie. we need to use app.use() instead of app.get()

//routes declaration
// as per standard practices we need to define api and its versioning also
app.use('/users', userRouter)
app.use('/api/v1/users', userRouter)
// works like below
// * app.js -> user.routes.js -> user.controller.js
// TODO the finally called url will be http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/register ...this is a kind of api which the frontend can hit
// TODO this api can be tested with thunderClient
// TODO yha route ka nam register ha and method ka name is registerUser

export { app }
